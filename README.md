### Authors
LJPcalc was created by [Scott W Harden](http://swharden.com/) in 2020. LJPcalc began as C# port of [JLJP](https://github.com/swharden/JLJP) by [Doriano Brogioli](https://sites.google.com/site/dbrogioli/) originally published on SourceForge in 2013. LJPcalc is heavily influenced by [Marino et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3640). See the [theory page](https://swharden.com/software/LJPcalc/theory.md.html) for implementation details.
